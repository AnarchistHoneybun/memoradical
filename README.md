Building the web app requires a Rust installation
with cargo, the wasm target, and trunk.
For details, please check out the [yew](https://yew.rs) documentation
on getting started.

To build and serve, use ...

    trunk serve

Or you can `trunk build` and copy the generated files to your web server.

See the online help after visiting the app.
